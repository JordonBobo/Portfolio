LX "Jordon" Bobo: Super Geek, turned Super Student, and now back to Geek. <br /> <br />

My interest in computers and coding started early. I built my first computer at age 11 
and my first website at age 14. In high school I was what you might call a super geek. I 
used a ram chip as a keychain. I carried a palm pilot in the days before cell phones 
became computers. I even had a genuine pocket protector with my school's logo on it. 
<br /> <br />

As I transitioned to college, my interests shifted to learning and education as a whole. 
I found myself studying a bit of everything. Economics, sociology, linguistics, history, 
and even agriculture, just to name a few. My passion became learning and exploring new 
ideas and concepts. I maintain this appreciation for new ideas and paradigms to this day. 
<br /> <br />

With a bachelors degree that included 3 minors and more than 200 credits, I entered the 
professional workforce and spent nearly 4 years trying to get a square peg to fit into 
a round hole. I loved the idea of working at a library, but my skills and abilities were 
being underutilized and I had a lot more to offer than I could ever give in that 
environment. <br /> <br />

I took inspiration for a career change when I helped the library acquire and implement 
an entirely new software platform and website. I also helped decide which updates 
needed to take priority as the software evolved to meet the needs of our customers 
and staff. Learning about the lifecycle of the different modules and how small changes 
could have such a significant impact on the user experience rekindled an interest in 
coding and software development. <br /> <br />

I soon after left the library in search of something more appropriate to my skills 
and abilities. At the Utah Higher Education Assistance Authority (UHEAA) I was able to 
show off my ability to adapt to a frequently changing environment and solve
complex problems. I eventually made my way into the Technology and Innovation department 
as a Systems Support Specialist. My job was to work with programmers, analysts, clients, 
and call center management to developed and maintained new programs and applications to 
meet the rapidly changing needs of the company and our clients. <br /> <br />

My passion for the work encouraged me to continue to develop my skills so I could be 
a more valuable asset to my team and to my own career. Although very well rounded in my 
abilities, my coding skills were mostly self taught and out of date. I knew coding would 
have the most value to my long term goals and last fall I enrolled in the University of Utahâ€™s &nbsp;
<a href="https://continue.utah.edu/proed/academy/certificate/web-coding-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="red"> 
Coding BootCamp</a> &nbsp; to significantly improve my coding skills. <br /> <br />

My intention was to become a more valuable member of my team and 
to use those skills to take on additional responsibilities and advance my position 
at UHEAA. Unfortunately the company faced difficult times and approximately half of their 
staff was laid off earlier this year, myself included. I continued with the Coding Bootcamp 
and graduated in June of 2021 with a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development. <br /> <br />

Recently my coding efforts have been focused on making a videogame called "Homesteader".
The game has been a slow process and I do not currently have a deployed version. The game 
uses modern tools and languages such as React, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to engage the 
player in decision making and prioritization to achieve goals to improve their homestead. 
It takes inspiration from vintage interactive fiction games such as Zork, as well as modern 
text based games such as A Dark Room by Doublespeak Games, or Kittens by Dark Souls. 
<br /> <br />

As I continue to develop and improve my skills, my goal is to utilize my diverse experience 
and education toward every project I work on and every team I work with. I am currently looking 
for new opportunities and am open to working for any company or organization that focuses on 
collaboration, innovation, and the improvement of our community.
